# string_capital\_letter\_counter:

###Java project containing a Java class CapitalLetterCounter.java, which counts uppercase letters in strings entered by the user.

## History:

### This project was developed for the LinkedIn Learning course "Java Essential Training: Syntax and Structure" by Angie Jones (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-essential-training-syntax-and-structure-16025610/). At the conclusion of the course, Ms. Jones advised her students to write a small Java program to fix the things we'd learned in our mind. This is the program I devised in response.

## Downloading the Program:

### Download either the folder `string_capital_letter_counter`with its subfolders and files. Alternatively, download the entire repoâ€”you'll get two additional files: `IntroductionAndOutput.png`and "CapitalLetterCounter.pdf", showing the entire source code and some output. (The source file itself is at `string_capital_letter_counter/src/CapitalLetterCounter.java`.)

## Running the Program:

### Since`string_capital_letter_counter`is an IntelliJ IDEA project, if you have IntelliJ IDEA you can just make a new project out of `string_capital_letter_counter` and run it. Or you can run it from the command line with

`cd <your repo>/string_capital_letter_counter/src`

`javac CapitalLetterCounter.java`

`java CapitalLetterCounter`

###(Use backslashes if you're running Windows.)


## Output

### You'll be prompted to enter string of letters. (Strings containing non-alphabetic characters will be rejected with an error message.) The program will keep reading your strings until you enter an empty string. At that point it will print each string, along with its total number of letters and the number of upper-case letters.

# Have fun!
